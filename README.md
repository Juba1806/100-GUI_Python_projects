<p>This repository is made for two groups of people. The people in the first group
are those who have already learned the basics of Python and programming
Introduction but are still unsure of how to write programs on their own. 
</p>
<p>
They may feel that programming hasn’t “clicked” for them. They may be able to solve the
practice exercises from their tutorials but still struggle to picture what a
complete program “looks like.” By first copying and then later re-creating
the projects in this repository, they’ll be exposed to how the programming 
concepts they’ve learned are assembled into a variety of real programs.
</p>
<p>
The people in the second group are those who are new to programming
but are excited and a bit adventurous. They want to dive right in and
get started making games, simulations, and number-crunching programs
right away. They’re fine with copying the code and learning along the way.
Or perhaps they already know how to program in another language but are
new to Python.
Experienced programmers might have fun with the programs in this
repository as well, but keep in mind that this repository was made for beginners.
