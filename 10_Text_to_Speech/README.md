## Make your computer talk to you 

This program demonstrates the use of the
gtts third-party module. Any message
you enter will be spoken out loud by your
operating system’s text-to-speech capabilities.
Although computer-generated speech is an incredibly
complex branch of computer science, the gtts 
module provides an easy interface for it, making this
small program suitable for beginners. Once you’ve
learned how to use the module, you can add generated
speech to your own programs.
